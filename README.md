Project Overview
This project provides personalized fashion and beauty recommendations based on a user's body type and skin tone. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, and leveraging a dataset from Myntra available on Kaggle, we aim to enhance users' fashion choices.

Features
Skin Tone Color Suggestions: Users select their skin tone, and our decision tree ML model provides a palette of colors that make them look radiant.

Body Type Recommendations: Users can either input their measurements or select their known body type. Our trained ML models then suggest outfits best suited for their body type.

Influencer Connection: Users are connected with influencers who share the same body type. By clicking on the 'Trendsetter' button in the navbar and selecting an influencer from the 'Influence from the Best' section, users are redirected to the influencer's Instagram handle for fashion tips and recommendations.
